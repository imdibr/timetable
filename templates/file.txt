import the neccessary libraries

function input xlsx file:
    input the xlsx file
    write the xlsx file into a dataframe

function generate timetable:
    create a 2x2 matrix for all the 9 different sections(2 years so 18 sections)
    the matrix should have days as the row and period number as the column

    each matrix should have variable name for each class like 2btcsa for section 2nd year 2 btcs a

    for each of the matrix set the fixed values like this 
    locked_classes = {
    "Monday": ["Period 4"],
    "Tuesday": ["Period 5", "Period 6"],
    "Friday": ["Period 5", "Period 6"],
    "Saturday": ["Period 5", "Period 6"],
}

function add lab sessions:
    now that the fixed classes are alloted append the neccessary classes to the array of indvidaual classes
    these are the different column values int the dataframe Subject Name, Teacher Name, 
    Year Name	Elective, Class Status, Class Name and so on
    from the dataframe check the year of the class and the class name and append them to the designated matrix
    once you reach the designated matrix check for the available slots to put the practical classes
    do this for all the 18 sections in one loop
    every matrix go through the whole length of the dataframe and append it

function print the xlsx file:
    now that all the matrix have been matrixized write the xlsx file for two year
    the final output should be the two xlsx file:
        Download 2nd Year Timetable
        Download 3rd Year Timetable
    for each matrix put the 9 sections in one file and the next 9 in the second file


rest all handle the flask app createion and the html file connection to index.html
